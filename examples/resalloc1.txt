// Should be adjusted in the resulting SBML file else.

PR is "Ribosome expression"
PS is "Structural biomass production"
Etrans1 is "Transporter enzyme"
Etrans2 is "Cofactor of transporter enzyme"
Etrans12 is "Transporter complex"
Emetab1 is "Generic metabolic enzyme"
Emetab2 is "Specialized metabolic enzyme"
R is "Ribosome"
S is "Structrual biomass component"

// biomass: B = 0.1 Etrans1 + 0.06 Etrans2 + 0.2 Emetab1 + 0.16 Emetab2 + 1 R + 0.1 S
// structural constraint: S >= 0.5 B
